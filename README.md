# Unciv Force Rating Calculator
This Python script takes input from the user to calculate the force rating of a base unit in a Unciv mod.

The calculations are based on [https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/Other/Force-rating-calculation/#base-unit-force-evaluation](https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/Other/Force-rating-calculation/#base-unit-force-evaluation).

Please note that this calculator does __not__ calculate civ force ratings/rankings, nor does it compensate for health/promotions.
